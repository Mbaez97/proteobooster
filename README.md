# ProteoBooster

ProteoBooster is a tool to automatically infer protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks for an entire proteome, and characterize this PPI networks by inferring protein complexes. If functional annotations are avilable for the proteome, complexes are also analyzed for function, providing a functional profile for as many putative complexes as possible.

This repository contains the code to download source databases to do this for any target proteome, as well as the scripts to automatically transfer the network and perform the subsequent analyses. A sister project, ProteoBooster-web, provides a web interface that can display information generated by ProteoBooster on a website.
